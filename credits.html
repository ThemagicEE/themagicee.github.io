                <h2>Why does this Website exist?</h2>
                <p>
                    I created this website after building my first Pwnagotchi. 
                    I had lots of trouble getting mine to work because many resources are outdated. 
                    I had to dig through Discord servers and old guides to figure things out. 
                    That's why I created this guide to help anyone who wants to build one themselves. 
                    I wanted to make an easy-to-follow guide, and I really hope it helps someone build 
                    their own Pwnagotchi. Another reason for creating this guide is to improve my English, 
                    as itâ€™s not my native language. I took this opportunity to better myself.

                    I will link all the different sources that helped me create this guide here.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, there is the original project, which I found first and used as a foundation to dig deeper.

                    Unfortunately, the original project is no longer up to date, 
                    but luckily there's a fork that is maintained by the community and kept current.

                    And then there's the community Discord, 
                    where I did a lot of troubleshooting while building my Pwnagotchi.<br>
